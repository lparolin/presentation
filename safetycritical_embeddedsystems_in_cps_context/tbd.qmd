Sensors for Advanced Driver Assistant Systems often operate in *degraded conditions*, e.g., due to adverse enviromental conditions

- E.g., cameras are affected by poor light and road. Lidar are sensitive to dust and water droplet deposit on the optical module


**Maps are sensors** are critical sensors that provide accurate information about geometry and semantic of roads and lanes and whose:

 - field of view (FOV) is not affected by traffic conditions
 - *data have unknown and potentially extensive latency*, e.g., days, or weeks


## Teaching Safety-Critical Thinking  
### Didactic Strategy & Tools

- Proposed modules:
  - Embedded Systems & CPS
  - Autonomous Driving & Safety
  - Real-Time Software Engineering
- Teaching methods:
  - Project-based learning
  - Simulation labs (ROS2, Carla, GitHub Classroom)
  - Quarto-based interactive documentation
